Work-in-progress

Plex-graph graph relationships between movies on your plex server(s).

plex_graph/plex.py - All the logic is dumped in this file current
- Edit this file to add your plex username / password.
- Uncomment generate_data() at the bottom of the file to collect new data
   from your plex server(s)
- Data is saved in a shelve so graphing can be tweaked without repeatedly
   indexing from the plex server(s); currently by commenting out generate_data().

./config.ini
- On first run this file will be written with credential for each plex server.

./shelve
- This file is created to cache plex movie data
