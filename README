Work-in-progress

Plex-graph graph relationships between movies on your plex server(s).

plex_graph/plex.py - All the logic is dumped in this file current
- Edit this file to add your plex username / password.
- Uncomment generate_data() at the bottom of the file to collect new data
   from your plex server(s)
- Data is saved in a shelve so graphing can be tweaked without repeatedly
   indexing from the plex server(s); currently by commenting out
   generate_data().

~/.config/plex-graph/config.ini
- On first run this file will be written with credential for each
  plex server.

~/.cache/plex-graph/shelve
- This file is created to cache plex movie data

TODO
- Consider moving to another visualization library like
https://pypi.org/project/nxviz/.  nxviz provides node coloring, etc.
Or https://github.com/WestHealth/pyvis which is interactive.
- Add an actual CLI with click
- A GUI?
